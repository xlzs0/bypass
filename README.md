nexus hvh (a server for 2020 csgo) had an anti-proxy plugin designed to kick players using newer versions of csgo, blocking usage of new cheats like skeet, neverlose, and others. this project was created to bypass that plugin and enable unrestricted access. since the server is no longer active, there's no reason to keep the source code private.  

**warning:**  
this was made while i was still learning, so it might include some *shitcode* and/or bad practices.  

**credits:**  
- **2020 proxy:** r3muxd & zxsleebu  
- **first bypass:** Clancy
